Description: This package includes the following parts. First, Three methods (extended gap statistic, extended prediction strength and S4) for estimating K and lambda simultaneously in sparse K-means are included in KL.Gap, KL.PS and KL.S4 respectively. Second, 11 methods for estimating K in K-means are included in K.Clust function. Third, nine high-dimensional datasets are also included with name starting with ``ds". Several simulation functions are included in Sim1, Sim2 and Sim3. The extensive simulation settings and real applications in this paper can also serve as a standard benchmark for evaluation purpose when new methods for simultaneous estimation of K and lambda are developed. Finally, an efficient algorithm for generate lambda grid for each K is included in the region.lambda.
